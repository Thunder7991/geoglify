## Objective

The primary goal of Geoglify is to provide a centralized platform for the analysis and visualization of data related to the sea. We aim to offer valuable insights into the shipping industry, maritime planning, and associated statistics, promoting a comprehensive understanding of the marine environment.

## Key Features (Future Objectives)

Our vision for Geoglify includes the implementation of the following key features:

1. **Maritime Data Visualization**: Future plans to develop interactive visualizations showcasing data on ships, maritime routes, oceanic conditions, and more.

2. **Enhanced Maritime Planning**: Ongoing efforts to build tools that will assist in efficient route planning, fleet management, and resource optimization in the naval industry.

3. **Comprehensive Industry Statistics**: Future development to provide up-to-date statistics on maritime traffic, types of vessels, weather patterns, and other relevant factors.

4. **Extended Maritime Data APIs**: Plans for seamless integration with APIs that will offer real-time data on sea conditions, ship locations, and other crucial information.
